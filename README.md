# Human-Auditory-Working-Memory
This code is to perform a parametric auditory working memory on human

** Without fixation point(+)

** With each trial feedback.

** With red and green square association when stimulus onset

** This task need mouse for getting response

In this task, subject self-initiated each trial by pressing the left key on the mouse.

The first sound is then presented together with a green square on the left side of a computer monitor in front of the subject.

A delay period, indicated by ‘WAIT!’ on the screen ( delay interval depends on your research question ).

The second sound is then presented together with a red square on the right side of the screen.

After displying green and red squares together, subject indicate choice by clicking on the green square (left side - first sound was louder) or the green square (right side - second sound was louder).

Then a question will be asked about the level confidence while responding to the trail.

At the end of every trial, a written feedback is displayed. ("False" with dark orchid color and "True" with turquoise color)
